||| Gloss hides the pain of drawing simple vector graphics behind a nice data type and
|||      a few display functions. 
|||
|||   Getting something on the screen is as easy as:
|||
|||  @
|||  import Graphics.Gloss
|||  main = `display` (InWindow \"Nice Window\" (200, 200) (10, 10)) `white` (`Circle` 80)
|||  @
|||
|||   Once the window is open you can use the following:
|||
||| @
||| * Quit            
|||   - esc-key
|||
||| * Move Viewport   
|||   - arrow keys
|||   - left-click drag
|||
||| * Zoom Viewport
|||   - page up/down-keys
|||   - control-left-click drag
|||   - right-click drag
|||   - mouse wheel
|||
||| * Rotate Viewport
|||   - home/end-keys
|||   - alt-left-click drag
|||
||| * Reset Viewport
|||   'r'-key
||| @
|||
|||
|||   Animations can be constructed similarly using the `animate`.
|||
|||   If you want to run a simulation based around finite time steps then try
|||   `simulate`.
|||
|||   If you want to manage your own key\/mouse events then use `play`.
||| 
|||   Gloss uses OpenGL under the hood, but you don't have to worry about any of that.
|||
|||   Gloss programs should be compiled with @-threaded@, otherwise the GHC runtime
|||   will limit the frame-rate to around 20Hz.
|||
|||   To build gloss using the GLFW window manager instead of GLUT use
|||        @cabal install gloss |||flags=\"GLFW -GLUT\"@
|||

||| Release Notes:
|||
|||  For 1.11.1:
|||   Thanks to Lars Wyssard
|||   * Use default display resolution in full-screen mode.
|||
|||  For 1.10.1:
|||   * Gloss no longer consumes CPU time when displaying static pictures.
|||   * Added displayIO wrapper for mostly static pictures, eg when
|||     plotting graphs generated from infrequently updated files.
|||   * Allow viewport to be scaled with control-left-click drag.
|||   * Rotation of viewport changed to alt-left-click drag.
|||   * Preserve current colour when rendering bitmpaps.
|||   * Changed to proper sum-of-squares colour mixing, rather than naive
|||     addition of components which was causing mixed colours to be too dark.
|||  Thanks to Thomas DuBuisson
|||   * Allow bitmaps to be specified in RGBA byte order as well as ABGR.
|||  Thanks to Gabriel Gonzalez
|||   * Package definitions for building with Stack.
