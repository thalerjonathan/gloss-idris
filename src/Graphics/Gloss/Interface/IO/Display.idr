||| Open a new window and display an infrequently updated picture.
|||
|||   Once the window is open you can use the same commands as with @display@.
|||
|||   * This wrapper is intended for mostly static pictures that do not
|||     need to be updated more than once per second. For example, the picture
|||     could show network activity over the last minute, a daily stock price,
|||     or a weather forecast. If you want to show a real-time animation where
|||     the frames are redrawn more frequently then use the `animate` wrapper
|||     instead.
|||
|||   * The provided picture generating action will be invoked, and the
|||     display redrawn in two situation:
|||     1) We receive a display event, like someone clicks on the window.
|||     2) When `controllerSetRedraw` has been set, some indeterminate time
|||     between the last redraw, and one second from that.
|||
|||   * Note that calling `controllerSetRedraw` indicates that the picture should
|||     be redrawn, but does not cause this to happen immediately, due to 
|||     limitations in the GLUT and GLFW window managers. The display runs on
|||     a one second timer interrupt, and if there have been no display events
|||     we need to wait for the next timer interrupt before redrawing.
|||     Having the timer interrupt period at 1 second keeps the CPU usage
|||     due to the context switches at under 1%.
|||
|||   * Also note that the picture generating action is called for every display
|||     event, so if the user pans the display then it will be invoked at 10hz 
|||     or more during the pan. If you are generating the picture by reading some
|||     on-disk files then you should track when the files were last updated
|||     and cache the picture between updates. Caching the picture avoids
|||     repeatedly reading and re-parsing your files during a pan. Consider
|||     storing your current picture in an IORef, passing an action that just
|||     reads this IORef, and forking a new thread that watches your files for updates.
|||
||| @ displayMode   Display mode.
||| @ backColor     Background color.
||| @ makePicture   Action to produce the current picture.
||| @ eatController Callback to take the display controller.
